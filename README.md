# JSL04 Project: Task Board with Local Storage Persistence and Task Creation Kanban App 

---

## What is Task Board with Local Storage Persistence and Task Creation? :
A Task Board with Local Storage and Task Creation is a simple web app that allows users to create tasks with a title, description, and status, and then visually display those tasks in columns like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". The app uses the browser's local storage to save the tasks so that they remain even after the page is refreshed. I'll be implementing this to my Kanban App.
